====== TweetDeck Enhancer Privacy Policy ======

It's important to maintain privacy when using products like these, which could potentially expose sensitive information to the extension.

TweetDeck itself does its own information collecting of it's own, through Google Analytics on Twitter's end. This is always present even with TweetDeck Enhancer off.
TweetDeck's Google Analytics is controlled by *Twitter*, NOT by me. However, Google Analytics' privacy policy is here: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/

I do NOT know:
-Who you are
-Where you live
-What your IP address is (Cloudflare's IP addresses are logged, and not yours)
-What you are doing
-With whom you are doing things with

I DO know:
-The version of TweetDeck Enhancer you are running
-Your user agent

If you are not familiar, the user agent simply contains operating system and web browser information, here's an example:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.101 Safari/537.36

You are completely anonymous when using TweetDeck Enhancer.

The version and user agent information is sent when you launch TweetDeck Enhancer.
This simply helps us know which versions of TweetDeck Enhancer are being used, and on which platforms it's being used, to improve services.

No information whatsoever is shared with third parties.
